/* 
1. Use relative units and not px
2. Declare font size as a % of default for browsers
    which is 16px, best for people who choose a higher
    default setting (poor eyesight)
3. Use inheritance as much as possible
    declare box-sizing in the body to border-box
    in the * selector, declare box-sizing inherit
