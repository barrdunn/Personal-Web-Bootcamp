/* Layers of processing
1. Declared Value
    what the user declares

2. Cascaded value
    value after the cascade is applied

3. Specified value
    Default value of a certain CSS property; 
    not relevant when there is already a cascaded value.
    But each CSS property has an initial value, used if
    no cascaded (declared) value

4. Computed value
    converting relative values to absolute
    color declarations like "white" are computed
    i.e. root font value (rem) = 16px, CSS declared 1.5rem, so
    computed value is 24px.

    % (fonts)           * parents computed font size                -
    % (lengths)         * parents computed width                    -
    em (font)           * parents computed font size                -   FONT BASED
    em (lengths)        * current element's computed font size      -   FONT BASED
    rem                 * root computed font size                   -   FONT BASED
    vh                  * viewport height                           -   VIEWPORT BASED
    vw                  * viewport width                            -   VIEWPORT BASED

    em = parent's computed font size
    rem = root computed font size 

5. Used value:
    in the rendering of the page, browser takes the 
    percentage/relative value and creates a pixel value,
    an actual value ready to be used in the layout
