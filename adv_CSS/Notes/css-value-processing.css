/* Layers of processing
1. Declared Value
    what the user declares

2. Cascaded value
    value after the cascade is applied

3. Specified value
    Default value of a certain CSS property; 
    not relevant when there is already a cascaded value.
           ** But each CSS property has an initial value, used if
              no cascaded (declared) value (AND if there is no inheritance)  **

4. Computed value
    converting relative values to absolute
    color declarations like "white" are computed
    i.e. root font value (rem) = 16px, CSS declared 1.5rem, so
    computed value is 24px.

    % (fonts)           * parents computed font size                -
    % (lengths)         * parents computed width                    -
    em (font)           * parents computed font size                -   FONT BASED
    em (lengths)        * current element's computed font size      -   FONT BASED
    rem                 * root computed font size                   -   FONT BASED
    vh                  * viewport height                           -   VIEWPORT BASED
    vw                  * viewport width                            -   VIEWPORT BASED

    em = parent's computed font size
    rem = root computed font size 

5. Used value:
    in the rendering of the page, browser takes the 
    percentage/relative value and creates a pixel value,
    an actual value ready to be used in the layout

/* INHERITANCE 
A way of propagating property values from the parent to
their child elements

CSS decision tree:
1. is there a cascated value?
Yes: Value = cascaded value     No: Is the property inherited?
                                Yes: Specified value = computed value of parent element      No: Specified value is initial value

Properties related to text are inherited
