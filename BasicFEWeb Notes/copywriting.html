<!-- What exactly is copywriting? Copywriting is the 
    art and science of writing copy (words used on 
    web pages, ads, promotional materials, etc.) that 
    sells your product or service and convinces 
    prospective customers to take action. In many 
    ways, itâ€™s like hiring one salesman to reach all 
    of your customers. 
    
    A sales team contacts customers one at a time; a 
    copywriter reaches all of them at once through 
    billboards, magazine ads, sales letters, blog 
    posts, and more. -->

    <!-- Design, content marketing, SEO, and growth 
        hacking are all parts of a complete digital 
        marketing plan, but copywriting is the glue 
        that ties it all together. Copy gives your 
        design meaning and lays the foundation for 
        your content marketing, SEO, and growth 
        hacking. 
        
        Writing better copy enables you to 
        convert more readers into customers, and w
        e wanted to provide a guide that would give 
        you an advantage when writing copy both on 
        and offline. -->
