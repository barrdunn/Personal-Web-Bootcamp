/* Enhancing page speed 

1. optimize heavy images
    *use chrome inspector to see image size displayed, vs actual size
    *remember to account for repsonsive design, images sometimes get bigger
    *image size should always be twice as much as they appear-for hi res displays.
    *use preview in mac to reduce size
    *compress biggest images

2. minify CSS and jQuery code */
